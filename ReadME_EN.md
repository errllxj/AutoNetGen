### 📥 Installation

* Continue AI model design: You can click it[链接](https://chat.openai.com/share/f61b0f8a-34b0-4dc7-b5f2-bf517ee5cdd6) 
* To re-start it, open GPT-4 [Advanced Data Analysis（原 Code Interpreter）功能](https://chat.openai.com/?model=gpt-4-code-interpreter)，并将[AutoNetGen.txt](prompts/AutoNetGen.txt)中的所有内容复制粘贴进对话框中运行。

#### Preconditions

⚠️ **Code execution is required, so it must use GPT-4 with Advanced Data Analysis enabled（Code Interpreter）。Currently, the feature is only available to ChatGPT Plus users.**

⚠️ **The code generated by ChatGPT may have unknown bugs, please check carefully before using it in a production environment!**

### Known issues
Due to the instability of the OpenAI Advanced Data Analysis environment state itself and the limitations of GPT's own capabilities, there are the following known issues (if you have a better solution, please contact the author):
1. The environment check result cannot be displayed correctly: The environment check code execution is successful, and the execution result cannot be displayed correctly on the web page.
2. File cannot be downloaded: The file download link is invalid
3. Loss of environment state: The environment is changed and the previous execution results are lost
4. The content of the downloaded code file is incorrect: find the corresponding steps, click show work to view the original code, you can manually copy the code and save it
5. Resource exceeded limit: The network is too large and there is insufficient memory
